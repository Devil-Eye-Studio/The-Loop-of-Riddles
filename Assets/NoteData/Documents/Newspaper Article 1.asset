  noteText: "Coalland City's Newspaper\n\nDate: October 19, 2011 \n\nTwo years later,
    detectives are still unable to find the cause of these mysterious murders. At
    the scene of the crime there are no signs of illegal entry into the house, and
    even more so on the victim there are no signs of a struggle. An autopsy did not
    reveal the presence of poisoning or internal hemorrhage. The search for the murderer
    continues. "
