  noteText: "Coalland City's Newspaper\n\nDate: November 11, 2011 \n\nThe murders
    continue. The investigation established that the murderer is not alone, since
    the murders are committed in several places at almost the same time. The head
    of one of the police department commented on this situation:\r\n- \"These people
    are clearly professionals in their thing, they don't leave any traces, this confuses
    the work of our department. We do our best to find them.\""
