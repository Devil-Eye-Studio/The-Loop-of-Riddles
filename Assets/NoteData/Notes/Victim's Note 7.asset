    die soon ...\nI installed a three-digit combination lock on the case. This case
    contains cure test samples.\n\n<color=red>THREE</color> days have passed since
    the appearance of these bugs. The disease progresses very quickly. \n\nWho will
    find this case, please, finish the development and be careful, whoever wanted
    me to close the project will probably try to steal the cure. "
