  noteText: "I've seen them again! Fucking bugs! THEY COME FOR ME.\r\n\r\nThe last
    time I crushed one of these, I saw that it was made of metal and inside it was
    a capsule with a strange substance. A few days later I heard that the person
    who lived on the floor above me had been murdered by the same strange murderer.\r\nI
    decided to take a look at this strange capsule. These were nanobots.\nApparently
    they kill a person under the guise of a disease, but the symptoms in one day
    are greatly exacerbated and the person dies, and the nanobots themselves leave
    the body.\r\nI started to make a cure for this disease, but I couldn't get more
    funds because of these dummies at the bank.\r\nApparently the person who created
    these bugs found out that I'm making a cure and sent them to kill me. \nThe cure
    is in a state of testing and can't yet be used.\r\nI hope I have time to finish
    the cure before the moment when I... die."
